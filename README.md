# Thermal-Calculator-App
A MATLAB app that measures the temperature of a system as a function of time given the overall resistance and capacitance.

# How it works
The GUI displays the effect of resistance and capacitance on a system. Changing the knobs of these values results in slight changes on the graph and switching between the 2 theta_a values describes the effect of temperature on a system.
