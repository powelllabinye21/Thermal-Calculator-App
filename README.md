# Thermal-Calculator-App
A MATLAB app that measures the temperature of a system as a function of time given the overall resistance and capacitance.

# Description
The GUI displays the effect of resistance and capacitance on a system. Changing the knobs of these values results in slight changes on the graph and switching between the 2 theta_a values describes the effect of temperature on a system.

# How it runs
To run the app, you have to first run the app code from the Task 1 MATLAB file which is linked to the Simulink design on the Task2 Simulink. Running the Simulink model loads the data for the app which will be displayed by opening it using the "Design apps" File found in Apps on the task bar.
